### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, this is Sena. I am an MSc. student of Media Informatics at the Technical University of Berlin and the Free University of Berlin. I am currently working as a working student assisting product managing and automation in a startup. 

Besides my studies, I am also interested in generative art, XR and VR technologies. I participated in several projects in these areas during my academical studies. 

Outside academia, I am an avid binge watcher, a cinephile, photographer and an experimental cook.
